I am a first-year PhD Student in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. I am advised by Dr. Amy Clement and my graduate research focuses on the evolving role of the ocean and atmosphere on global climate variability in climate models. 

I grew up in a tiny town in northern Maine and extreme winters became my norm, then I moved to central Pennsylvania where I was shocked to get days off of school for an inch or two of snow. At a young age, I became interested in climate and weather and how people interacted with them. Though I have shifted away from my original my goal of going into broadcast, I have followed through on the plan that I formed in fourth grade to become a meteorologist.

I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in Spring 2025, where I received a B.S. in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, along with minors in Marine Science and Geography, and an undergraduate certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS). I was a Schreyer Honors Scholar and was a 2023-2025 NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholar. During my undergraduate career, I participated in multiple research experiences in the Penn State Department of Meteorology on biogeochemistry and carbon capture implementation in the Chespeake Bay, an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Plymouth State University focusing on the carbon and energy budgets of a forest using eddy covariance, and interned with the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory through the Hollings Program where I studied the impact of ENSO on the California Current System.

In my free time, I can be found hiking, painting, traveling, reading, and enjoying live music.
