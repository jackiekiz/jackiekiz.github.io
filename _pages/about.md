I am a first-year PhD Student in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. I am advised by Dr. Amy Clement and my graduate research focuses on the evolving role of the ocean and atmosphere on global climate variability in climate models. 

I grew up in a tiny town in northern Maine where extreme winters became my norm, then I moved to central Pennsylvania and was shocked to get days off of school for an inch or two of snow. At a young age, I became interested in climate and weather and how people interacted with them. Though I've shifted away from my original my goal of going into broadcast, I did follow through on the plan I made in fourth grade to become a meteorologist.

I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in Spring 2025, where I received a B.S. with Honors in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, along with minors in Marine Science and Geography, and an undergraduate certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS). I also spent a semester abroad at the University of Southampton and the National Oceanographic Centre (NOCS) studying physical oceanography in England.

I had a variety of research experiences as an undergraduate, including biogeochemistry and carbon capture implementation in the Chespeake Bay in the Penn State Meteorology Department, an NSF REU focusing on the carbon and energy budgets of a forest using eddy covariance, and I interned with the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory through the NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Program where I studied the impact of ENSO on the California Current System.

In my free time, I can be found hiking, painting, traveling, reading, and enjoying live music.
