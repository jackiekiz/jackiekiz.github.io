I am a first-year PhD Student in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. I am advised by Dr. Amy Clement and my graduate research focuses on the evolving role of the ocean and atmosphere in global climate variability in climate models. 

I first decided that I wanted to study atmospheric science when a fourth-grade class project instructed me to select a job from a provided list in a packet. The point of the project was to learn about taxes and financial budgeting based on arbitrary careers and incomes, but I took away much more than that. I decided that the job of a meteorologist sounded fascinating; I had always enjoyed science and math and was passionate about the natural environment and its protection. As I grew older, I became increasingly aware of observable changes in our weather and climate patterns attributed to anthropogenic climate change, which sparked a new motivation and sense of responsibility to study the climate system.

I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in Spring 2025, where I received a B.S. with Honors in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, along with minors in Marine Science and Geography, and an undergraduate certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS). I spent a semester abroad at the University of Southampton and the National Oceanographic Centre (NOCS) studying physical oceanography in England. I also had a variety of research experiences as an undergraduate in the Penn State Meteorology Department, through an NSF REU, and through the NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Program.

In my free time, I can be found reading, painting, traveling, hiking, watching football, and enjoying live music.
